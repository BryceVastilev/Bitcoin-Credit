## What is Gigacoin?
Gigacoin is a Experimental Peer to Peer Currency that will have no Centralized Institution, Service or 3rd Party. Rather your Gigacoins are managed by the Gigacoin Blockchain. How it works is you make a transaction and the Gigacoin Blockchain assigns a computer to process your transaction. To prevent fraud we use many measures of security to keep your Gigacoins safe. There is not printing a Gigacoin rather 
we make it a limited virtual resource. There is so many years of Gigacoin that can be mined. There for adding value. A notable example is
Gold.
